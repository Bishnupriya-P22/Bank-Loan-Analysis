# Bank-Loan-Analysis
## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a comprehensive Bank Loan Dataset to evaluate lending performance, borrower profiles, credit risk, and repayment behavior. The goal is to transform raw financial data into actionable insights that support informed lending decisions and effective risk management.

The analysis covers 38,000+ loan records, providing a consolidated view of loan amounts, interest rates, income levels, credit grades, and repayment trends.

## Purpose & Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:
Monitor loan disbursement trends
Analyze borrower income and employment patterns
Evaluate credit grades and risk levels
Understand interest rate distribution
Assess repayment performance and portfolio health

This analysis helps financial institutions optimize credit strategies and improve lending efficiency.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Data analysis and processing
Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and aggregation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment
Excel Dataset – Source data

## Data Preparation

Removed duplicate records
Handled missing values in employment and income fields
Standardized categorical variables (Grade, Term, Home Ownership)
Converted date columns for time-based analysis
Ensured numeric consistency for loan amount, income, interest rate, and DTI

## Key Features of Analysis

Borrower profiling based on income, employment length, and home ownership
Credit risk assessment using loan grades and sub-grades
Loan performance evaluation using total payment analysis
Interest rate and loan amount distribution analysis
Time-based trend analysis using loan issue dates

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Loan Amount Disbursed: $435+ Million
Average Loan Amount: $11,296
Average Interest Rate: 12.05%
Average Annual Income: $69,644

These KPIs provide insights into portfolio size, lending exposure, borrower affordability, and risk distribution.

## Visual Insights & Observations
